# E-Commerce-Churn-Analysis-Project

# Overview 
Welcome to the E-Commerce Churn Analysis Project! This repository contains the comprehensive codebase and documentation for our efforts to predict customer churn in our e-commerce business. We employed various machine learning models, conducted extensive exploratory data analysis (EDA), implemented feature engineering, and fine-tuned models to achieve an impressive accuracy score of 91%.

# Domain Prequites Knowledge:
Electronic commerce is buying and selling goods or services through the internet. The products are advertised on e-commerce websites developed by online retailers. Types of eCommerce portals are B2B, B2C, C2C. Some of the features like an exhaustive range of option for product to select from, 24 x7 availability of product to select desired items, options of paying like net banking, credit cards, cash on delivery, a guarantee of secured transactions, refund option in case of return of purchased items, wishlist, order status, quick pay options. E-commerce market tend to use a lot of NLP for sentiment analysis and customer behavior.I would also specifically mention that knowledge of Statistical Programming and Distributed Computing are essential

# Important Features:
Multiple Models: We employed a variety of machine learning models, including Random Forest, Gaussian Naive Bayes, and Gradient Boosting Classifier, to predict customer churn. Each model was thoroughly evaluated and fine-tuned for optimal performance.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Our EDA process involved in-depth exploration of the dataset, identifying patterns, correlations, and outliers. Visualizations and statistical tests provided valuable insights into the underlying dynamics of customer behavior

Feature Engineering: We engineered meaningful features from the dataset, including purchase frequency, average order value, and customer interaction metrics. This enhanced the models' ability to capture relevant patterns and improve prediction accuracy.

Feature Selection: To optimize model performance and reduce complexity, we employed feature selection techniques, identifying the most impactful variables for predicting churn.

Normalization: Normalization techniques were applied to ensure consistent scales across features, contributing to the stability and convergence of machine learning models.

Hyperparameter Tuning:We fine-tuned model hyperparameters using rigorous optimization techniques to extract the best performance from each algorithm. Balanced Dataset: Addressing the class imbalance in the dataset, we employed techniques such as oversampling and undersampling to ensure the models were trained on a balanced representation of churn and non-churn instances.

# Results
Our predictive models achieved an impressive accuracy score of 91%, showcasing the effectiveness of the applied techniques in identifying and predicting customer churn.
